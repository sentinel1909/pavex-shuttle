# Pavex and Shuttle

This repo reflects on-going work/effort to bring the [Pavex](https://pavex.dev) web framework to [Shuttle](https://shuttle.dev).

This work is a continuation of the effort by Alexander Jophus [Creating a full stack web app in Rust 2/3](https://blog.alexanderjophus.dev/posts/rust-full-stack-2/)
